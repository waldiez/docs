# Contributing to Waldiez Projects

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Waldiez repositories! Below, youâ€™ll find the guidelines for contributing code, documentation, and ideas to our various projects. We welcome contributions of all types, including new features, bug fixes, and documentation improvements.

## 1. Getting Started

- **Fork the Repository**: Fork the repository you want to contribute to by clicking the "Fork" button on GitHub.
- **Clone Your Fork**: Clone the forked repository to your local machine.
    <!--markdownlint-disable MD034-->

   `git clone https://github.com/YOU/REPOSITORY-NAME.git`

- **Set Upstream**: Add the original repository as a remote upstream.

   `git remote add upstream https://github.com/waldiez/REPOSITORY-NAME.git`

- **Check for Requirements**: Some projects may have specific dependencies or setup instructions listed in a `README` or `CONTRIBUTING.md` file within the repository.

## 2. Contribution Guidelines

Before making any changes, please read through our organization-wide contribution guidelines:

- **Open an Issue First**: For larger changes, open an issue to discuss your proposed changes with the maintainers. This helps avoid duplicate work and ensures alignment with project goals.
- **Follow the Code of Conduct**: Review and adhere to our [Code of Conduct](../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
- **Respect Repository Owners**: Each repository may have its own set of maintainers or reviewers. Follow their guidelines for submitting work and await feedback before merging.

## 3. Submitting Issues

If you notice a bug or have a feature request:

- **Check Existing Issues**: Before creating a new issue, search the issues in the repository to avoid duplicates.
- **Open a New Issue**: Use a descriptive title and include any necessary details (e.g., steps to reproduce for bugs).
- **Add Labels**: If possible, label your issue as a `bug`, `enhancement`, `documentation`, or `question`.
- **Follow the Issue Template** (if available): Some repositories may have specific templates for bug reports, feature requests, etc.

### 4. Working on Issues

If you want to work on an existing issue:

- **Check for an Assignee**: If no one is assigned, comment on the issue and ask to be assigned.
- **Claim the Issue**: Wait for a maintainer to assign the issue to you to avoid duplicate work.
- **Create a New Branch**: Use a descriptive name for your branch.

    git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

## 5. Submitting Pull Requests

When youâ€™re ready to submit your changes:

- **Sync with Upstream**: Pull the latest changes from the upstream repository and resolve any conflicts.

    git fetch upstream
    git merge upstream/main

- **Create a Pull Request**: Push your branch to your fork and open a pull request (PR) to the original repository.

- **Write a Descriptive Title and Message**: Briefly describe your changes and the issue it addresses.

- **Link the Related Issue**: Use keywords like `Closes #ISSUE_NUMBER` to link to the relevant issue.

- **Await Review**: A maintainer will review your PR. Be ready to make changes based on feedback.

## 6. Code Style & Best Practices

To maintain code consistency:

- **Follow Project Coding Standards**: Refer to any coding guidelines or `.editorconfig` /`eslint` / `flake8` / `pyproject.toml` files in the repository.
- **Write Tests**: Ensure new features or fixes are covered by tests, where applicable.
- **Add Documentation**: If your changes require updates to the documentation, make those in the appropriate files.

## 7. Project-Specific Instructions

Some repositories may have additional instructions:

- **[waldiez/waldiez](https://github.com/waldiez/waldiez)**: The core python part of the project. Responsible for converting waldiez flows to python scripts and jupyter notebooks, as well as running them.
- **[waldiez/react](https://github.com/waldiez/react)**: The frontend part of the project. Responsible for creating the user interface for waldiez flows.
- **[waldiez/jupyter](https://github.com/waldiez/jupyter)**: It combines the python and react parts above. It is responsible for running the python scripts and jupyter notebooks created by the user.
- **[waldiez/studio](https://github.com/waldiez/studio)**: A standalone (without jupyter) web app that also combines the python and react parts above. Once ready, it will be included as an extra requirement in the waldiez pypi package.
- **[waldiez/vscode](https://github.com/waldiez/vscode)**: A waldiez vscode extension: Open .waldiez files in vscode convert them to python scripts and jupyter notebooks, and run them.
