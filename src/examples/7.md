# Group Chat with Retrieval Augmented Generation

In this example, we configure a group chat environment with multiple agents, each assigned a specific role. A **Boss Assistant** agent utilizes **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** to help solve complex problems by retrieving relevant information and responding accurately. The task involves using Spark for parallel training in FLAML.

![Example 7 overview](../static/images/dark/examples/7/overview.webp#only-dark)

## Overview

The workflow includes:

- **Boss Assistant Agent**: Assists with extra content retrieval power for solving difficult problems.
- **(Group) Manager Agent**: Manages the group chat environment.
- **Code Reviewer Agent**: Reviews the code.
- **Product Manager Agent**: Designs and plans the project.
- **Senior Python Engineer Agent**: Writes code to solve problems and answer questions.

## Agents setup

### Boss Assistant Agent

Drag and drop a new User Proxy agent to the canvas and configure it as follows:

- **Name**: Boss Assistant
- **Description**: Assistant with extra content retrieval power for solving difficult problems.
- **Max consecutive auto reply**: Set to **3**.
- **Agent Default Auto Reply**: Reply `TERMINATE` if the task is done.

 Also check **Use RAG** box and configure the RAG settings as follows:

![RAG Agent setup](../static/images/dark/examples/7/rag_agent.webp#only-dark)

#### Retrieve Config Tab

- **Task**: Set the task type to **Code**.
- **Docs Paths**: Since the task is about using Spark for parallel training in FLAML, we use the following document path: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/FLAML/main/website/docs/Examples/Integrate%20-%20Spark.md`
- **Collection Name**: `groupchat`
- **Number of Results**: Set to **3**.

#### Vector DB Config

- **Vector DB**: Chroma
- **Embedding Model**: all-MiniLM-L6-v2, the default for Chroma.
- **Use Persistent Storage**: Checked
- **Storage Path**: `documents`

!!! Note
    Feel free to experiment with different settings to optimize the retrieval process.

#### Termination

On the **Termination** tab, setup a simple *keyword-based* termination rule with the keyword `TERMINATE` and *Keyword is the last word* as the termination criterion.

#### Model

Link a model of your choice to the **Boss Assistant**. In our example, we use the `gpt-3.5-turbo` model.

### Group Manager Agent

Drag and drop a new Group agent to the canvas and configure the Group chat settings as follows:

- **Admin Name**: `boss_assistant`
- **Max Rounds** to `12`.
- **Speakers Configuration**: Set the speaker selection method to **Round robin** and allow speaker repetition.
- **Model**: Link a model of your choice to the **Group Manager**. In our example, we use the `gpt-3.5-turbo` model.

### Group Members

Drag and drop the following agents to the **Group Manager** agent:

#### Code Reviewer Agent

- System Message: You are a code reviewer. Reply `TERMINATE` at the end when everything is done.
- Add the Termination rule with the keyword `TERMINATE`.
- Link a model of your choice to the **Code Reviewer** agent.

#### Product Manager Agent

- System Message: You are a product manager. Reply `TERMINATE` at the end when everything is done.
- Add the Termination rule with the keyword `TERMINATE`.
- Link a model of your choice to the **Product Manager** agent.

#### Senior Python Engineer Agent

- System Message: You are a senior python engineer, you provide python code to answer questions. Reply `TERMINATE` in the end when everything is done.
- Add the Termination rule with the keyword `TERMINATE`.
- Link a model of your choice to the **Senior Python Engineer** agent.

### Connections

Add a link between the **Boss Assistant** and the **Group Manager** to start the conversation.
For the message, this type we use the **RAG Message Generator**. It uses autogen's [`sender.message_generator`](https://ag2ai.github.io/ag2/docs/reference/agentchat/contrib/retrieve_user_proxy_agent#message_generator) method to generate the message to pass to the **Group Manager**.

## Workflow

Before running the flow, open the *Edit flow* modal as usual, and add the one connection we have to the flow. Run the flow using the *play* button and inspect the logs to monitor the conversation between the agents.
