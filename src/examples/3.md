![Example 3 overview](../static/images/light/examples/3/overview.webp#only-light)
![Example 3 overview](../static/images/dark/examples/3/overview.webp#only-dark)

In this example, we will setup up a workflow for reviewing and improving blog posts using nested chats. The workflow includes roles for a writer, critic, and various reviewers (SEO, Legal, Ethics, and Meta).

## Agent Roles

- **Writer**: Writes blog posts based on given topics.
- **Critic**: Asks for reviews and provides feedback on the writer's work.
- **SEO Reviewer**: Optimizes content for search engines.
- **Legal Reviewer**: Ensures content is legally compliant.
- **Ethics Reviewer**: Ensures content is ethically sound.
- **Meta Reviewer**: Aggregates feedback from other reviewers.

## Models Used

Feel free to use any models that suit your requirements. Here are the models used in this example:

- **SEO Reviewer**: `gpt-3.5-turbo`
- **Legal Reviewer**: `gpt-3.5-turbo`
- **Ethics Reviewer**: `gpt-3.5-turbo`
- **Meta Reviewer**: `gpt-3.5-turbo`
- **Writer**: `gpt-3.5-turbo`
- **Critic**: `gpt-3.5-turbo`

## Setup the Agents

### SEO Reviewer

1. Add an agent named **SEO reviewer**.
2. In the *System Message*, set:

    ```text
    You are an SEO reviewer, known for your ability to optimize content for search engines, ensuring that it ranks well and attracts organic traffic. Make sure your suggestion is concise (within 3 bullet points), concrete and to the point. Begin the review by stating your role.
    ```

3. Link the agent to a model.

    ```

3. Link the agent to a model.

### Meta Reviewer

1. Add an agent named **Meta reviewer**.
2. In the *System Message*, set:

### Writer Agent

1. Add a new agent named **Writer**.
2. In the *System Message*, set:

    ```text
    You are a writer. You write engaging and concise blog posts (with title) on given topics. You must polish your writing based on the feedback you receive and give a refined version. Only return your final work without additional comments.
    ```

3. Link the agent to a model.

### Critic Agent

1. Add a new agent named **Critic**.
2. In the *System Message*, set:

   ```text
   You are a critic. You review the work of the writer and provide constructive feedback to help improve the quality of the content.
   ```

3. Link the agent to a model.

!!! Note
    We will come back to the Critic agent to configure nested chats after setting up the agent connections.

## Agent Connections

### Writer => Critic

1. Connect the **Critic** agent to the **Writer** agent.
2. On the message tab, set the type to "Text" and the content to:

    ```text
    Write a concise but engaging blog post about DeepLearning.AI. Make sure the blog post is within 100 words.
    ```

### Nested chats

For the rest of the connections, we will set up nested chats to gather feedback from the SEO, Legal, Ethics, and Meta reviewers. Add a link from the **Critic** agent to each of the reviewers, and set the chat type to "Nested Chat". Set **Max turns** to 1 and **Summary method** to "Last Message".
For the nested chat content, we will use a custom method to send the content to the SEO, Legal, and Ethics reviewers:

```python
def nested_chat_message(recipient, messages, sender, config):
"""Ask for a review."""
return f"""Review the following content.
        \n\n {recipient.chat_messages_for_summary(sender)[-1]['content']}"""
```

![Nested Chat message](../static/images/dark/examples/3/nested_message.webp#only-dark)

For the Meta reviewer, we use the "Text" type:

```text
Aggregate feedback from all reviewers and give final suggestions on the writing.
```

### Nested chat registration

1. Go to the **Critic** agentâ€™s settings and navigate to the *Nested Chats* tab.
2. The nested chat is triggered when the writer replies to the critic's message with the content to be reviewed, so on the "Triggered by" select the **Writer** agent and check the "Agent's reply" box.
3. Set up the messages to be sent when the chat is triggered:
   - **Critic => SEO reviewer**
   - **Critic => Legal reviewer**
   - **Critic => Ethics reviewer**
   - **Critic => Meta reviewer**

---

## 4. **Workflow Flow Order**

1. Open the **Edit Flow** menu.
2. Name the flow as **Reflection** or another suitable name.
3. Set the initial flow order to start with **Critic => Writer**.

---

## 5. Run the flow

We are ready to run the flow. Hit the play button to start the flow. The critic will ask the writer to write a blog post about DeepLearning.AI. The writer will then write the blog post and send it to the critic for review. The critic will then send the content to the SEO, Legal, Ethics, and Meta reviewers for feedback. You can check the logs to see the flow of the conversation.
